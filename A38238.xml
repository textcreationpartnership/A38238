         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is this day Ordered by the Houſe of Commons now aſſembled in Parliament, That the Preamble, together with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, which the Members of this Houſe made the third of May, ſhall be forthwith Printed, and the Copies Printed brought to the Clark of the ſaid Houſe, to atteſt under his hand, to the end that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes may ſend them down to the Sheriffs and Juſtices of Peace of the ſeverall Shires, and to the Citizens and Burgeſſes of the ſeverall Cities, Boroughs, and Cinque Ports, reſpectively. And the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, are to intimate unto the Shires, Cities, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, and Cinque Ports, with what willingneſſe all the Members of this Houſe made this Proteſtation: And further to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that as they juſtifie the taking of it in themſelves, ſo they cannot but approve it in all ſuch as ſhall take it.</p>
            <p>WE the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Commons houſe in Parliament, finding, to the great grief of our hearts, that the deſignes of the Prieſts and Jeſuites, and other Adherents to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> have of late been more boldly and frequently put in practice then formerly, to the undermining and danger of the ruine of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion in His Majeſties Dominions eſtabliſhed: And finding alſo that there have been, and having juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that there ſtill are, even during this ſitting in Parliament, indeavours to ſubvert the fundamentall Laws of England and Ireland, and to introduce the exerciſe of an Arbitrary and Tyrannicall Government, by moſt pernicious and wicked Councels, Practiſes, Plots, and Conſpiracies: And that the long intermiſſion, and unhappy breach of Parliaments, hath occaſioned many illegall Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, whereupon the Subject hath been proſecuted and grieved: And that divers Innovations and Superſtitions have been brought into the Church; multitudes driven out of His Majeſties Dominions; Jealouſies raiſed and fomented betwixt the King and His People; a Popiſh Army leavied in Ireland, and two Armies brought into the bowels of this Kingdome, to the hazard of His Majeſties Royall Perſon, the conſumption of the Revenues of the Crown, and Treaſure of this Kingdome: And laſtly, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great cauſe of Jealouſie, that indeavours have been, and are uſed to bring the Engliſh Army into a miſunderſtanding of this Parliament, thereby to incline that Army, with force to bring to paſſe thoſe wicked Councels, Have therefore thought good to joyn our ſelves in a Declaration of our united Affections and Reſolutions, and to make this enſuing Proteſtation.</p>
